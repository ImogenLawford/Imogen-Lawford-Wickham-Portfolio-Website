    <p class="aboutMeText">I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 8. After a rough transition to multiple daily injections, I was able to resume my normal routine and continue my active lifestyle. But this was not without the sacrifice of my mental and physical health. My blood sugars were frantically spiking high and low, even more so when I tried to exercise, making everything I tried to do difficult and scary.</p>

  <h4 class="timelinetitle">2015: STEM and healthcare</h4>
<p class="aboutMeText">Over the next couple of years, I started to learn about new innovative technology to improve glucose management. I was the first diabetic in my Hospital to start using a continuous glucose monitor. It allowed me to view a continuous graph of my BG throughout the day, rather than 4-5 scattered values. A massive step in the right direction, but there was still so much more room for technology to help, and my first hand experience as a T1D patient gave me inside knowledge into the precise gaps in management that needed to be filled!

  <h4 class="timelinetitle">2016: National Science Fair</h4>
  <p class="aboutMeText">In 2016 for our school science fair, I decided to put all of my passion for easing diabetic management into a project; and maybe actually make a difference. As a very active athlete, I have always struggled with nighttime lows and as a heavy sleeper, would often not wake up to my phone's alert, putting me at risk of a hypoglycaemic seizure. To solve this, my project was an innovation to avoid hypoglycaemic unawareness at night, and more effectively alert the patient. I learned about electrical engineering circuitry, sensors, microprocessors and simple coding to produce a circuit that would detect a low blood glucose through the production of breath acetone (a byproduct of low BG) and trigger a motor vibration to wake the patient. For this project, I was given the opportunity to go to Canada Wide Science Fair where I was awarded a silver medal. </p>

  <h4 class="timelinetitle">2017: Artificial Pancreas</h4>
  <p class="aboutMeText">I continued to pursue this path of STEM integrated to help chronic disease management as I programmed my own artificial pancreas in 2017. I used open-source software (OpenAPS) from a community movement of diabetic patients called 'We Are Not Waiting'. The circuit included a Raspberry Pi, Carelink stick, Rileylink, a 'hackable' medtronic insulin pump and my iphone. The system tracks my glucose readings, and adjusts my basal rates accordingly every 5 minutes to keep me inside my target range.  </p>

<h4 class="timelinetitle"> 2021: Technovation Girls</h4>
<p class="aboutMeText">In March of 2021, I competed in the Technovation Intervational app coding competition. The app I programmed is called MyBeta, and it integrates AI to help youth with T1D use their continuous glucose monitor data to effectively adjust insulin settings and improve glucose control.</p>

   <h4 class="timelinetitle">2021: Canada Learning Code</h4>
  <p class="aboutMeText">As a volunteer teen mentor at CLC, I developed and taught workshops about coding to young student, helping inspire their interest in computer science and helping them complete coding projects. I focused on integrating under-represented populations in STEM and promoting an interest in this field for youth! </p>

     <h4 class="timelinetitle">2021: Queens Summer Engineering Academy</h4>
  <p class="aboutMeText">As a member of QSEA, I learned about mechatronics and software engineering, particularly their applications in the future with AI. I also explored the applications of software engineering for career opportunities with an increasingly technological-dependent society.

   <h4 class="timelinetitle">2021: Girls Who Code Immersion Program</h4>
<p class="aboutMeText">As a student at GWC SIP, I learned how to write code in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I learned about the individual capabilities of each language in forming different aspects of a web platform, as well as how to connect all three languages to interact with the user. My first project was programming this website! </p>

   <h4 class="timelinetitle">2022: Kingston Summer Company Grant</h4>
<p class="aboutMeText">As a recipient of the Kingston Summer Company Grant, I started my own mobile app business. I programmed and developed FireScape, a mobile app to improve fire safety for firefighters and citizens in the time of an emergency. This incredible experience is opening my eyes to the integration of entrepreneurship and software programming and motivates me to continue pursuing this field.</p>
