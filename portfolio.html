    <div class="cardProjects1">
    <p>FireScape is a mobile app I programmed and developed that allows homeowners to improve their fire safety, plan their escape, and instant provide support in an emergency. In 2022, was awarded the Kingston Summer Company Grant to continue developing the app, and run my business. FireScape is currently in the launch phase.</p>
    <p class="projlink">To learn more about FireScape, you can visit  <a href="https://www.firescape.app/">FireScape's website</a>
      and watch <a href="https://youtu.be/loTL_T9QoQg/">FireScape's demo video</a> </p>

    <div class="cardProjects">
    <p>In 2016, I built and programmed a prototype innovative mouthguard for Type 1 diabetics to detect nocturnal hypoglyceamia and alert the patient through a vibration, thus avoiding a hypoglycaemic seizure. For this project, I competed at Canada Wide Science Fair in Montreal, where I was awarded a silver medal and two awards.</p>
    <p class="projlink">To view my project overview, details and awards, check out my page on the <a href="https://secure.youthscience.ca/virtualcwsf/projectdetails.php?id=4861&">CWSF archives website</a> </p>

Also pictured is a medtronic insulin pump, connected via bluetooth to the rest of the circuit hardware." >
<div class="cardProjects">
    <p>In 2017, I programmed my own artificial pancreas OpenAPS system using open-source software. It automatically adjusts my insulin pump basal rates based on glucose readings from my continuous glucose monitor using the opensource algorithm, in order to keep my glucose levels inside target range. </p>
    <p class="projlink">To learn more about my artificial pancreas and the patient movement for self-automated glucose control, visit <a href="https://openaps.org/"> the OpenAPS wesbite</a> </p>

The image on the far left and far right depict the CGM trend comparison page, providing sample CGM trend graphs and information on insulin sensitivity. The middle image shows the homepage. It features three menu options to 'find a mentor', go to the 'CGM trend comparison' page, or view 'personal data'.">
    <div class="cardProjects">
    <p>In 2021, I participated in Technovation Girls, an international app-coding competition. I programmed an app called My Beta. My app integrates AI to help youth with T1D use their continuous glucose monitor data to effectively adjust insulin settings and improve glucose control.

    <div class="cardProjects">
    <p>In 2021, I programmed a buzzfeed-style personality quiz using a combination of HTML (for content), CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for user-interaction) to provide the user with a result based on their unique inputs.
